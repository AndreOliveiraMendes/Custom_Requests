Request for customs here if you don't know how to script and/or make art.

Guideline

-Prefer to make a pull request with a cdb or text doc of the contents of the customs. If you have art you wish to use, upload it with the pull.

-You may create a "issue" as a request but provide links of art if you have art you wish to use and the cards detail.

-If you don't know how to do ether, you may post your cards here. http://duelistsunite.org/forum/forum/84-create-a-card/

-Not all customs will be able to be scripted. There is limits. The ones that cannot will be closed.

-Custom summons or attributes are not allowed. Custom types are still allowed.

-Refer to Livecustom as a general guide line. https://github.com/Gideon9212/Livecustom
